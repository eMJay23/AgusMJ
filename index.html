                        <p>Amorsolo is one of the most important painters in Filipino Art History. His paintings were able to embody the simplicity of Filipinos, in its daily lives and beauty. Just by looking at this painting, we can all say that the “Fruit Gatherer” is the original dalagang filipina.

                            “The women I paint should have a rounded face, not of the oval type often presented to us in newspapers and magazine illustrations. The eyes should be exceptionally lively, not the dreamy, sleepy type that characterizes the Mongolian. The nose should be of the blunt form but firm and strongly marked. … So the ideal Filipina beauty should not necessarily be white complexioned, nor of the dark brown color of the typical Malayan, but of the clear skin or fresh colored type which we often witness when we met a blushing girl.”

                    <p>by: Fernando Amorsolo, 1945</p>
                    <p>The artist, known for his vibrant and peaceful paintings, also depicted World War II in the Philippines, highlighting the devastation and sadness but also expressing hope through the light on a young Filipino woman holding her child.</p>

                        <p>Another masterpiece from Amorsolo is Hope in the Ruins of Manila. He was known for his bright colors and peaceful paintings, but he also represented the years of World War II, when the Japanese were occupying the Philippines. He’s able to depict the war, and the devastation it brings to people – but in the middle of that sadness and desperation, he gives us a hint of hope. The way the light shines, on the young Filipino woman holding her child, gives us hope for a brighter future that will be built by these children.</p>

                            Technique: Oil on canvas <br>
                            Date: 1884 <br>
                            Location: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (currently on loan to the National Gallery Singapore)</p>

                        <p>This painting was a silver medalist during the 1884 Exposicion General de Bellas Artes in Madrid, Spain, also known as the Madrid Exposition. Hidalgo’s winning the silver medal for the painting was a landmark achievement that proved the ability of Filipinos to match the work of Spaniards and laid claim to Filipino participation in European culture. Sadly, what we have now at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is just a copy, because the original one was destroyed in a fire at the University of Valladolid in Spain.

                            After winning at the Exposition in Madrid, a small group of Filipino expatriates and members of the Philippine reform movement held a victory celebration. During the party, José Rizal gave a speech regarding the achievement of Hidalgo and Luna as a proof that the talents of Filipino artists equaled those of the Spaniards. In relation to such evidence, Rizal questioned the inequality in political rights and freedom between Filipinos and Spaniards. Graciano Lopez-Jaena in turn orated that Hidalgo and Luna were propaganda painters who exposed the “lamentable conditions” of the Philippines while under the tutelage of the Spaniards.</p>

                            Date: 1886 <br>
                            Location: Lopez Memorial Museum</p>

                        <p>España y Filipinas, meaning “Spain and the Philippines”, is an 1886 oil on wood by Filipino painter, ilustrado, and revolutionary activist, Juan Luna. It is an allegorical depiction of two women together, one a representation of Spain and the other of the Philippines. The painting, also known as España Guiando a Filipinas (“Spain Leading the Philippines“), is regarded as one of the “enduring pieces of legacy” that the Filipinos inherited from Luna. The painting is a centerpiece art at the Luna Hall of the Lopez Memorial Museum.

                            The Spaniard woman “Motherland” was drawn with “wide strong shoulders” while the Filipino woman was illustrated as “graceful” and brown-skinned. Both were wearing female dresses known as traje de mestiza or “dress of the mestiza”. The dressing of the women in traje de mestizas shows the cultural character, class consciousness, and social transformations resulting from 19th century Hispanization. Both women have their backs to the viewer, heading towards a far-away horizon, while embarking on the steps of a staircase. Side by side in the painting, Spain was shown to be leading the Philippines along the path to progress and development.</p>

                            <p>The Blood Compact is an “historic and historical” painting by Filipino painter Juan Luna. The scene painted by the artist portrays the 1565 Sandugo (blood compact ritual) between Datu Sikatuna of Bohol and Miguel López de Legazpi, surrounded by other conquistadores. Datu Sikatuna was described to be ‘being crowded out of the picture by Miguel López de Legazpi and his fellow conquistadores’. This is one of the last paintings created by Luna.
                                <br> <br>
                                Trivia: José Rizal and Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera helped Luna in completing the painting by providing historical advice and posing for the painter: Rizal posed as Sikatuna while Pardo de Tavera posed as Legazpi.

                            <p>Jose Joya is a painter and multimedia artist who distinguished himself by creating an authentic Filipino abstract idiom that transcended foreign influences.

                                He espoused the value of kinetic energy and spontaneity in painting which became significant artistic values in Philippine art. His paintings clearly show his mastery of ‘gestural paintings’ where the paint is applied intuitively and spontaneously, in broad brush strokes, using brushes or spatula or is directly squeezed from the tube and splashed across the canvas.  His 1958 landmark painting Granadean Arabesque, a work on canvas big enough to be called a mural, features swipes and gobs of impasto and sand. The choice of Joya to represent the Philippines in the 1964 Venice Biennial itself represents a high peak in the rise of modern art in the country.

                            <p>Ang Kiukok was a Filipino painter known for his expressive, Cubist-like works. He often chose dynamic or disturbing subject matter, frequently depicting rabid dogs, crucifixions, and screaming figures in an abstracted geometric style. When asked why he often chose subjects full of such angry he once replied “Why not? Open your eyes. Look around you. So much anger, sorrow, ugliness. And also madness.“

        <p>Filipino art, a reflection of the country's rich culture, began during the prehistoric era and was influenced by Spanish colonization in the 16th century. Art played a significant role in<br> spreading Catholicism and promoting Christianity. In
            the early 19th century, the focus shifted from the church to native culture, including landscapes,<br> fashion, jewelry, and furniture. Post-World War II, artists began depicting battle scenes and suffering. Today, Filipino artists continue

            <br> contribute to contemporary art, experimenting with modern expressions.</p>
